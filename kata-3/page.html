      <p>Programming is the best job ever! You get to build stuff and problem-solve all day long. It&rsquo;s like playing with Lego all day...except they aren&rsquo;t physical, come in infinite shapes, and are more capable. And you get paid to do it! It isn&rsquo;t always easy though. It can be mentally very difficult and takes a long time to get really proficient. But it is totally worth it.</p>

      <p>Web development generally involves two types of technology, front-end and back-end. Front-end tech involves displaying things in the browser and the code executes in the browser. Back-end tech executes on the server, not the browser. If you are using Python for your server-side language, this is a representative tech stack:</p>

      <div class="tech-stacks">
        <div class="front-end">
          <h2>Front-End</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="back-end">
          <h2>Back-End</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Django</li>
            <li>Postgresql</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This is a good way full stack to begin programming with!</p>
